# Getting started tutorial - Metwork Framework

## Welcome to the Metwork Framework

The MetWork Framework will litterally change the way you build, run and monitor your applications. You are going to save a lot of time!

In this tutorial, we are going to take a fresh CentOS 7 VM, install MetWork Framework, build a small api with the framework. And then we will see how we can monitor this api, deploy it, connect it to a database, and create bullet proof background tasks.

These steps should take a few minutes only!
